    "When working on any data related problem, the challenge in today's world is the sheer volume of data, and the variables/features that define that data. To solve a problem where data is the key, you need extensive data exploration like finding out how the variables are correlated or understanding the distribution of a few variables. Considering that there are a large number of variables or dimensions along which the data is distributed, visualization can be a challenge and almost impossible.\n",
    "Hence, PCA can do that for you since it projects the data into a lower dimension, thereby allowing you to visualize the data in a 2D or 3D space with a naked eye.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Speeding Machine Learning (ML) Algorithm:\n",
    "\n",
    "Since PCA's main idea is dimensionality reduction, you can leverage that to speed up your machine learning algorithm's training and testing time considering your data has a lot of features, and the ML algorithm's learning is too slow.\n"
